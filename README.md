# Elizabeth's Portfolio

## Website
This website was created to display my portfolio for future employers to look at. I started this website by adding all of the HTML first and then added the CSS afterwards. All of the projects on this website are linked to the actual final live project. I have added media queries to make this website responsive for all sized windows. All of the images on the website do have attributes attached. Also, my resume is linked as well to my website.
